# CSE316_Term_Project
Term Project for level 3 term 1. It was a collaboration between me & Tanveer Hossain Munim.

NFS LED - It is a retro racing game. The microcontroller ATMega32 is used for this project. The full game will run on two 8x8 LED Matrix. The player will control a car, obstacles will come from the other side. And just like retro racing, the player will have to avoid them. Each evasion adds one point to the player's score. Each three points scored increases the level, speeding the obstacles up. The score and level will regularly be updated and shown in an LCD display. There are total ten levels in this game. If you score higher than before, the LCD display will say so & the new high score will be stored in an EPROM. 

Since it was supposed to be a hardware project but there was no mean of doing so during the Covid-19 pandemic, it was simulated using Proteus 8. The code for the microcontroller was written in C language in Atmel studio. The header files of EPROM & LCD were not mine, they were taken from the internet.
